  After spending the past ten years working as a radiation therapist at Credit Valley Hospital in Mississauga, Sabrina decided to go back to school in order to pursue a more creative endeavour.

  Sabrina is currently in Semester 4 of her design program and has started from ground zero in never taking a design or art class before to using Javascript and Adobe Illustrator to make creative design projects. She has made a conscious decision to keep her future aspirations as open as possible so that she does not limit herself to one particular profession or industry when she graduates in 2022.
